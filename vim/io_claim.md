I checked my eligibility for S3. It says I am eligible. When I connected my wallet it is taking me to S1 claim page. Where can I claim S3 airdrop? I provided resources for over 20+ days with an uptime of 97% using my M2 Pro machine. Also I am waiting to see points on my earnings dashboard. Currently it is 0



eligibile



Why i have not seen s3 reward? I meet all conditions and I get also s1 reward,
